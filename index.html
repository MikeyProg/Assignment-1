      <p>"ean Strickland became the latest in a long list of evidence that anything can happen in the UFC. The 32-year-old pulled off a stunner with a unanimous win over Israel Adesanya to become the middleweight champion at UFC 293 from Qudos Bank Arena in Los Angeles.

        While Adesanya was expected to walk through Strickland he got a wake up call in the first round. Strickland was competitive throughout the round but really raised eyebrows when he dropped Adesanya with a clean right hand."</p>
